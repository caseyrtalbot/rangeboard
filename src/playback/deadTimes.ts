/**
 * The one dead rule, a per-ship latch that matches the engine's targeting
 * (attrition.ts: a ship whose survival is below SHIP_DEAD_BELOW is never
 * targeted, and each event's killDelta is the mass that salvo removed from
 * ship `shipIdx`). Per ship, alive is 1 minus the summed killDelta of that
 * ship's events in effect-time order (ledger order on a tie); the ship
 * latches dead at the event where alive first falls strictly below the
 * cutoff. killDelta is never negative, so the latch is one-way. The threat is
 * dead once every ship in [0, shipCount) has latched, at the latest ship
 * latch: the effect that killed its last ship. A threat that never reaches
 * that is alive (null).
 *
 * Late kill mass counts here exactly like pre-arrival mass: whether the
 * airframe still flies is a survival question, and a late kill still
 * destroys it. Fractional mass (the deterministic readers) and whole-ship
 * draws (every trial) go through the same rule.
