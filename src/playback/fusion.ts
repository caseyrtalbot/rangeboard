/**
 * Track-to-track fusion at a C2 node (lane 2.4). `fuseTracks` combines
 * member sensor tracks in information form: the fused information is the
 * sum of the member inverse covariances, the fused covariance its inverse
 * and the fused state the covariance-weighted mean. `createFusionStage`
 * runs it once per sweep step for one threat: it holds the per-sensor
 * estimates the tracker emits, applies the sensor-to-C2 link latency and
 * fuses the reports that have reached a C2 node. Board meters throughout.
 *
 * Latency. A sensor report reaches the C2 one link latency after the
 * sensor made it, so at time t the C2 holds each sensor's estimate as of
 * t - latency. The stage keeps a short per-sensor ring of past estimates
 * (latency / DT + 1 entries, the objects the tracker already allocated for
 * the sink) and carries the delayed entry to t with the tracker's own
 * constant-velocity `predict`, so the covariance grows by the process noise
 * over the delay the way a real C2 dead-reckons a stale report. A ring
 * rather than a predict-only path because the estimate as of t - latency is
 * not recoverable from the estimate at t. The truth path bypasses the
 * latency: a truth member is exact at t by definition (zero covariance,
 * quality 1), so a fused track that has a truth member is the truth at t
 * with zero covariance and `source: 'truth'`, and a `truthTracks` run is
 * unchanged by fusion.
 *
 * No C2 node: every live sensor track fuses at the sensors with no latency,
 * so today's behaviour holds. A sensor with no C2 link on a board that has
 * links fuses at the sensors too (NO_C2) and competes with the nodes on
 * quality, so a radar wired straight to an effector still reaches the
 * picture.
 *
 * Truth members off the `truthTracks` switch. The tracker sends a sensor
 * with no range or azimuth accuracy down the truth path (tracker.ts
 * `truthPathFor`), and every RF and acoustic sensor in the library has no
 * range accuracy. When the switch is off, such a member would otherwise
 * make every mixed fusion exact, so the stage drops truth members from a
 * fusion that has at least one estimate member; a fusion whose members are
 * all truth (a laydown with no accuracy data) stands as before. With the
 * switch on nothing changes. Phase 3: a bearing-only sensor should become a
 * measurement with range sigma equal to its detect range instead.
