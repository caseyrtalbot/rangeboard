 * Per-sensor track management on top of the sweep's detection decisions.
 * The sweep decides who holds, coasts and drops (sweep.ts); the tracker
 * gives each held sensor-threat pair a state estimate. One track per
 * (sensor, threat): a formation is one track whose measurement is the
 * nearest detected member. On a measured step the Kalman filter updates
 * from the truth position plus polar noise; on a carried or coasting step
 * it predicts only, so the covariance grows; a sensor the sweep does not
 * hold this step loses its track.
 *
 * Truth path: a sensor without both `rangeAccuracyM` and
 * `azimuthAccuracyDeg`, or any sensor under the `truthTracks` switch,
 * reports the truth position and velocity with zero covariance, quality 1
 * and consumes no draw. The noise draw is taken on the estimate path only.
