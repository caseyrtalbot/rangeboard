 * accumulation as the old `t += DT` loop, so every sample time at 0.5 s is
 * bit-identical to the fixed step.
 *
 * Fine step: `requestFineStep(effectorId, fromS, toS,
 * stepS)` asks for `stepS` (clamped to baseS) on [fromS, toS). It may be
 * called before or during the sweep; it takes effect at the next `next(t)`.
 * Honoured only inside the window: the sweep enters the window at `fromS`
 * (when fromS falls between two base samples), samples at the finest
 * requested step of every window containing t, lands on `toS`, then returns
 * to the base grid `originS + k * baseS` at the first grid time after the
 * window. A request with a non-positive step, an empty window, or a window
 * that ends at or before `t` changes nothing. Requests are per clock, so a
 * burst in one replicate never touches another.
