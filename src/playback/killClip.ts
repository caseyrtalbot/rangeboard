/**
 * Kill clip: a dead threat holds no track. The sweep, the tracker and the
 * fusion stage run one threat at a time and finish before the engagement
 * pass, which reads their fused track (attrition.ts), so the sweep cannot
 * learn the kill while it runs. This pass runs after the engagement pass and
 * clips what the sweep produced at the kill: the per-step fused tracks, each
 * sensor observation's hold and coast intervals, the track estimates and the
 * scan records of the killed threat. The kill time is the one dead rule
 * (`deadTimeOf`, deadTimes.ts): per ship, the effect at which its survival
 * falls below SHIP_DEAD_BELOW, and for the threat the effect that killed its
 * last ship. That rule is the engagement pass's own targeting cutoff (a ship
 * below the cutoff draws no fire), so the clip and the engine agree on when
 * the threat stopped being a target.
 *
 * Only a hard kill clips. A mission-killed airframe (a jammer's kill under
 * `jamBehavior` drift or return-home) still flies, so its holds, estimates
 * and fused track run to the path end; an all-soft defeat does not clip. A
 * mixed defeat (one ship hard-killed, another mission-killed) does not clip
 * either: a mission-killed airframe of that threat still flies and the threat
 * has one picture. The clip applies when every ship of the threat latched
 * hard, at the last hard-kill latch: the hard cut (`hardKillTimeOf`).
 *
 * A sample at or before the kill measured a live target and is kept; a hold
 * or coast interval ends at the last sweep sample at or before the kill (the
 * sweep grid is delayS + k * stepS, the kill is off it), and that sample
 * draws its one step, so a hold can overhang an off-grid kill by less than a
 * step. The first sample after the kill, and everything later, is dropped.
 *
 * The report is never touched: every count the engagement pass produced
 * stands, and the timeline's ghost span (kill to planned arrival) reads the
 * report. `trackQuality` stays as swept: the continuity the sensors would
 * have held to closest approach. The per-threat milestones after the cut are
 * nulled: the classification rungs, `stableTrackAtS` and
 * `declaredHostileAtS`; `firstDetectS`, `engageGateS`, `windowS`, `cpaS`,
 * `arrivalS` and `warningS` are planning values and stay. An assessment with no kill or nothing to
 * clip, and every list and observation with nothing to drop, comes back as
 * the same object.
