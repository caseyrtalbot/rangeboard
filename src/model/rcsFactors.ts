/**
 * Radar cross section planning factors for T&E laydown work.
 *
 * The threat study (docs/threat, section 18) lists radar cross section by
 * aspect and frequency as a value that is NOT consistently available in
 * public high-confidence sources, so nothing here is measured signature
 * data. The tiers are representative X/Ku-band nose-on class values used
 * to scale each radar's quoted detect range to the threat in front of it,
 * so the board and the analysis agree on who sees what, and from how far.
 *
 * Anchors from vendor datasheets that condition a range on an RCS:
 *   Blighter A400/A422: 2.73 km at 0.01 m2 (DJI Phantom-class small drone),
 *   4.87 km at 0.1 m2, 8.66 km at 1.0 m2, 15.4 km at 10 m2. The four points
 *   follow the fourth-root law to within 1 percent.
 *   Echodyne EchoGuard: Phantom 4 over 1 km, Matrice 600 over 1.4 km, so
 *   the Group 2 airframe returns about 4x the Group 1 energy.
 *   HENSOLDT SPEXER 2000: UAV (0.2 m2 per trade reporting) 9 km, micro-UAV
 *   6 km, which back-solves to about 0.04 m2 for the micro-UAV line.
