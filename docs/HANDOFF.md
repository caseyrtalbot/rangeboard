# RangeBoard handoff

RangeBoard is a modeling and simulation tool for counter-UAS test-plan sizing. Its
physical and statistical models are surrogates built from public vendor data and open
literature. It controls no hardware and produces no targeting data.

This is one file, rewritten in place and never appended. Git history is the archive.
Completed work lives in the dated evidence indexed in [README.md](README.md) and the
commit log. This file holds only the position, the current task and the landmines. A
fresh agent starts from this file and the docs index. This file does not authorize a
commit, push or merge.

[Plan.md](Plan.md), the design and UX polish plan, is complete. No row of it is
selected. The polish follow-up run, the third polish run (polish3) and the fourth polish
run (polish4) that came after it are also complete.

## Position

- Repository `~/Projects/rangeboard`. Local `main` is the sole integration branch.
  `origin/main` holds the plan commit `0386b3a`, Rows A, B and C (B-int `2028d35`, C-int
  `d806e33`), the polish follow-up integration `b979358` and the polish3 run (`1b39c03`).
  Local `main` adds the polish4 run: the lane merges of `polish4/placement`,
  `polish4/cue`, `polish4/fidelity`, `polish4/canvas`, `polish4/chrome`, `polish4/trim`
  and `polish4/pool`, and the integration commit that holds this handoff. The audit fixes
  `181c8ec` to `7da197d` and the documentation update after them follow row J (`afaf1ae`)
  and row O (`de208aa`).
- The authorized estimate-path recapture is `225e027`. Its expects: layered events 11,
  layered kill mass 1, layered kills mean 1.115, JIATF leakers mean 0.895, JIATF kills
  mean 0.105. `4.68` is not a pin.
- The flight horizon is `7fdcb1e`.
- Entry gzip at the polish4 gate: 365,724 bytes against 367,000, 1,276 bytes of headroom.
  Initial JavaScript and CSS: 382,285 bytes against 400,000.

## Tasking

No task is open and no candidate is open. Do not add a row to [Plan.md](Plan.md). The
next task comes from the user.

The polish4 run closed all eleven polish3 candidates and two defects it found:

- A redo adds the scenario it makes current to `redone` (`src/state/scenarioInstall.ts`,
  a session-only `WeakSet`). `actionBeforeMount` names nothing for it, so a redo made
  before the cue chunk loads shows no cue.
- The Palette sets `--library-w` on `.board-stage`. With the drawer open the undo cue caps
  its width to the room right of the drawer and moves off screen below 160 px of room.
- The system rotation handle and the move-underlay outline take the tool ink (5.3:1 on
  paper). `layoutLabels` takes `handleDeg` and boxes a label where `anchoredLabelTop`
  draws it. The heading handle moves the label on its Konva node during the drag. Anchored
  names and spoke callouts draw over a glyph halo (`LABEL_HALO_PX`, 2.5 px stroke).
- `boundsRefusal` refuses every boundary whose non-adjacent edges cross, touch or overlap,
  whatever its net area.
- The top bar grid has equal side tracks, so the tabs hold the center at every width from
  about 1115 px. Chips drop off whole, and the ROE button counts hidden chips at every
  width. The Storage panel opens under its trigger and stays inside the viewport. The
  narrowest supported window is 1024 px.
- The policy test and the E3 laydown test used wall-clock ids from `newId`; both now use
  fixed ids. `mergePartials` with `prefix` sizes its grids to the contiguous prefix.
- The `gun-burst` tag requires an active UAS with a library `uas` spec.
- `finishSummary` at the retained cap takes a median of 1,438.7 ms in the summary worker
  (evidence below).
- A raid-size sweep gives added ships the ids `${sourceId}~r${i}`, so a sweep at one seed
  is reproducible.
- The canvas context menu loads as its own chunk, fetched when `CanvasStage.tsx` runs.

These results are decisions, not open work: the coverage wedge and the label collision
box follow the committed heading during a drag; the gun-burst tag reads the scenario and
not which pairs engage; `store.trial.test.ts` keeps its store-made run id (0 of 2,000
probe ids failed).

## Landmines

- `shot.ts` calls `predictionSigmaAtS(est, est.state.tS + flightS)` with
  `flightS = max(0, intercept.tEffectS - (t + es.engageTimeS))`.
  `kinetic.verify.test.ts` still feeds hand-supplied miss sigmas.
  `kinetic.horizon.test.ts` is the regression that uses `predictionSigmaAtS`. Do not
  put `engageTimeS` back into that call.
- Do not change the estimate-path expects above. Do not restore 16, 0, and 0.005.
- A saved builtin that omits `flyoutSpeedMps` adopts the seed cruise speed. An
  interceptor with no positive cruise speed uses `kineticPk`, matching
  `flyoutProfile`. Coyote is 154 m/s and MEROPS is 78 m/s. Roadrunner and Anvil have
  no seed cruise speed, so they stay on the legacy curve.
- `seekerAcquisitionRangeM` gates feasibility only. Nothing reduces miss sigma for a
  seeker-equipped round.
- Physics tab: a checked box selects the prior planning fallback; a cleared box selects
  the physical model when its required fields are present.
- Do not restore `src/analysis/series.ts`, `withBands` or `TRACK_LADDER_STYLE`.
- No production `as unknown as` remains in model or state. Test fixtures still use
  that cast. `basisJson` (`src/model/basisJson.ts`) sorts object keys and preserves
  array order. `dropEditedProvenance`, `resetBuiltin`, and `sameAppliedOverrides`
  use it.
- A run's identity is its basis signature and the override list it applied. An override
  edit that changes a value in force reaches the store only through the
  `useOverrides.subscribe` line at the end of `src/state/store.ts`. A throw from that
  line is reported to the override boundary in `main.tsx`. The shell in
  `OverrideSubscriber.tsx` stays armed while its alert is showing, so a later throw
  does not leave `setState`. The overrides autosave subscription stays outside that
  boundary. A throw before the shell mounts still leaves `setState`.
- The Systems tab is the only view that shows an override; rings, WEZ, telemetry and the
  Prepare forecast read `trial.scenario` or the board scenario, which keep the library
  value.
- Chunk grids are packed row-major `Float64Array`s (`i * steps + k`). `finish`
  transfers those buffers. Do not structured-clone them onto the page to summarize.
  Progress `done` is the prefix, not every landed index. `discarded` is set only
  when finish commits a hole. The Run button stays Stopping while `pool.stopping`
  is set; `cancel` returns false for that wait.
- `mergePartials` with `release` empties each transferred part as it copies it. The
  summary worker clears the parts list before `finishSummary`.
- `tQuantile` keeps a one-entry module cache in `src/analysis/stats.ts`.
- The retained track history is a column ledger. `bound.tracks[i]` returns a fresh,
  equal object on each read. `latestEstimatesAt` uses the ledger's indexed horizon
  read. `releaseRetainedTrial` empties only the copy from `boundRetainedTrial`.
- The Fragility Sobol warning is a planning factor from one board: 29 entities at
  2560 rows took 499 s, scaled by entity count and row count, and it fires at half
  of `DEFAULT_BUDGET.timeMs`. It is not a clock reading for the board on screen.
- Load refuses a flight path or boundary with fewer than two points. A placement run
  refuses a boundary with fewer than three. In-memory fixtures may still hold an empty
  `points` array (`scenarioHasWork` in `src/io/persist.test.ts`,
  `scenarioInstall.test.ts`). Those objects do not pass `parseScenarioData`.
- `npm run check` does not run `check:bundle`; run it after `build` at every gate that
  touches the entry. The entry gzip budget is 367,000 bytes with 1,276 bytes headroom
  (last measured 365,724 at the polish4 gate). Icons and new components add entry bytes. `sql.js` must stay behind `await import` with its wasm URL.
- Never run bare `npx vitest run` while a worktree exists inside the repository. Scope
  with `--dir src`.
- `newId` embeds `Date.now()`. A test that asserts a seed-dependent Monte Carlo outcome
  must build its entities with fixed ids, or its random stream changes with the clock.
- Keep `.board-library-drawer` and `.undo-cue` siblings inside `.board-stage`; the cue
  reads `--library-w` there. The ROE `+N` count comes from one `ResizeObserver` on
  `.status-inline` in `Toolbar.tsx`.
- Lane worktrees share one `git stash` list. A lane must not use `git stash` while a
  sibling worktree exists; two lanes that popped at once swapped their diffs in polish3.
  Measure a baseline with `git diff > file` or a separate worktree at the base.
- Prettier wrapping of JSX text can change React `children`. Keep button labels on one
  line, or tests that compare `props.children` to a string will miss the control. See
  `src/ui/ErrorBoundary.tsx`.
- `library:check` and `schema:check` compare generated bytes. Do not hand-edit
  `*.generated.ts` or `src/io/runtimeSchema.ts`.
- Oxlint `only-export-components` warnings already exist; do not add more. `npm run lint`
  does not fail on them.
- The pool's budget is the main thread's: `DEFAULT_BUDGET.retainedNumbers` bounds the
  merged rows the page holds, not a worker. Raising it or `MAX_REPLICATES` in
  `RunTab.tsx` brings the tab crash back on large raids. The check is not a hard cap:
  in-flight chunks can still land.
- A throw inside the react-konva tree never reaches `src/ui/ErrorBoundary.tsx`; only
  `SceneErrorBoundary` sees it. Every layer belongs inside that boundary.
- `sobol-done` carries `result: null` on a cancel. Readers must handle the null.
- Every edit to a registered reference needs
  `npm run docs:review -- <document> --note "..."`, or `npm run docs:check` fails.
  Guides fingerprint `src/`, so a source commit after a docs review invalidates it.
  `docs:review` stamps `reviewedAt` with the UTC date.
- The weasel-word regex lives in `scripts/silent/rules/weasel-word.yml`, its `-tsx`
  twin, and `WEASEL_WORD` in `scripts/check-silent.mjs`. Change all three together.
- Every silent rule has a `-tsx` twin. The pair must stay identical except `id` and
  `language`.
- `storageManagement.ts` derives live keys from every non-prefix export of
  `storageKeys.ts`. Un-exporting `ANALYSIS_KEY` changes that readout.
- `selectObservedThroughWholeS`, `bandNote`, `bandStep`, and `TrialOutcomeSummary`
  have no importer. Un-exporting one of them fails `noUnusedLocals`. Do not delete
  them and do not add a suppression to keep them private.
